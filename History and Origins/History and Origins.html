    <p class="origin-text">
      The Ancient Olympic Games originated from a religious festival held in the city of Olympia. It was a place where Greeks of the same religion and beliefs gathered to honour Zeus the main character of the event. The first Games took place in the year 776 BC when Koroibos (a cook from the nearby city of Elis) won the first-ever stadion race (600 feet long, running race). However, this didn’t mean that the Games would right away consist of all the disciplines we know. Instead, the stadion race was the one and only athletic event of the Olympic Games for the first 13 festivals or until 724 BC when the diaulos foot race was added. From then the Olympic games were held at the same place and in the same format (just with some minor adjustments) for another 12 centuries.

    <p class="religion-text">This 5-day event was not only sport-centred since religion played a rather major role in its organisation and overall purpose. The main idea of the Ancient Olympic Games was that “you were training to please Zeus. But part of the festival would be to visit the temple, visit the cult statues, making offerings, celebrating and seeing your family,” as said by a professor of Greek archaeology from the University of Arizona David Gilman Romano. Meaning that yes, the athletes aimed to win, acquire great honour, and become recognised, but that wasn’t the main objective. The most important part of this event was the religious background which effectively made it not only a social event but also a ritual honouring Zeus and other gods.</p>

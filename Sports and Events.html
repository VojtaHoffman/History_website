            <p class="description-content" id="description-content">Olympia is an ancient Greek city located on the western side of the Peloponnese peninsula. The city's history spans over 1,000 years, with evidence of humans dating back to prehistoric times. Over the centuries, Olympia served as a significant religious and cultural center, attracting pilgrims from all over Greece who came to worship at its many temples, including the famous Temple of Zeus, one of the Seven Wonders of the ...

    <div class="sport-descriptions">
      <p class="sport-description">In ancient Greek Olympic games, athletes competed in running events on a hard-packed clay track while barefoot and dressed in only a loin cloth. The three main events included the Stade race, a prestigious 200-meter sprint along the Olympia track; the Diaulos, a 400-meter foot race equivalent to the modern 400-meter race but without starting blocks or specialized running shoes; and the Dolichos, a long-distance race ranging from 7 to 24 stades (approximately 1,400 to 4,800 meters), with no set distances or standardized track lengths.</p>

    <div class="sport-descriptions">
      <p class="sport-description">In Ancient Greece, the jumping event was called the long jump, and it involved a running start, similar to the modern long jump. However, the use of halteres (stone or lead weights) was unique to the ancient version, as athletes held these weights during the jump and released them at the end to increase their distance. This technique is not used in today's long jump events.</p>

    <h2 class="sport-name">Discus Throw</h2>
    <div class="sport-descriptions">
      <p class="sport-description">The ancient discus throw was similar to the modern freestyle discus throw, with athletes spinning and releasing the discus to achieve maximum distance. However, the materials used for the discus were different, as it was originally crafted from stone and later from iron, lead, or bronze. Today, the discus is typically made of wood, metal, or other materials with a standard weight and size.</p>

    <div class="sport-descriptions">
      <p class="sport-description">Ancient Greek wrestling, also known as pale, was more focused on grappling and submission holds than today's Olympic wrestling. The goal was to force an opponent to concede defeat, usually by making them touch the ground with their back, hips, or shoulders. Unlike modern wrestling, there were no points or weight classes in ancient Greek wrestling.</p>

    <div class="sport-descriptions">
      <p class="sport-description">Ancient Greek boxing, called pygmachia, was a more brutal sport compared to modern boxing. Fighters wore himantes, straps made of soft leather that evolved into hard leather, which often caused severe injuries to opponents. There were no rounds, weight classes, or gloves, and matches continued until one of the fighters was no longer able to continue or conceded defeat.</p>

    <div class="sport-descriptions">
      <p class="sport-description">Pankration was a no-holds-barred combat sport that combined elements of wrestling and boxing. It was more violent and less regulated than today's mixed martial arts (MMA), with few rules and no safety equipment. Biting and eye-gouging were the only prohibited actions in pankration, and matches continued until one fighter was incapacitated or surrendered.</p>

    <div class="sport-descriptions">
      <p class="sport-description">Ancient Greek equestrian events, held in the Hippodrome, included horse racing and chariot racing, which were more dangerous and less regulated than modern equestrian competitions. Riders and charioteers often competed without saddles or other safety equipment, and races were highly competitive and sometimes lethal. Today's equestrian events focus on dressage, show jumping, and eventing, with extensive safety regulations and equipment.</p>

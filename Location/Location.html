      Olympia is an ancient Greek city located on the western side of the Peloponnese peninsula. The city's history spans over 1,000 years, with evidence of humans dating back to prehistoric times. Over the centuries, Olympia served as a significant religious and cultural center, attracting pilgrims from all over Greece who came to worship at its many temples, including the famous Temple of Zeus, one of the Seven Wonders of the world. Olympia is also known for being the site of the very first Olympic Games, which were held in 776 B.C. in honor of Zeus. The games were held every four years for more than a millennium and had their own Olympic areal with sport facilities and temples. The site of Olympia was lost for centuries until it was rediscovered in the 18th century. Today, the ancient city is an important archaeological site and a major tourist attraction.
